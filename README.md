# Appointment booking system with login/registration system with admin panel.
 
# The development is finished.

# Installation steps:

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Unzip and paste into your xampp htdocs folder or on your server public_html folder.
3. Create a new database in your phpmyadmin with loginsystem name.
4. Import into this database the loginsystem.sql file. Which can be found in the loginsystem/includes folder.
5. Set the config.php file. Inside there are some help and examples. If you use it at online use the online version and write your own passwords. If you use xampp, then use the xampp version.
6. Finish.

The admin username: admin
The admin password: Test@12345

I would like to later create some email sending methods for notification the user and the admin about the bookings. But I'll do this only, when the project owner bought a domain and the storage for it.
